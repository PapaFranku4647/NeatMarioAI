# Neat Mario AI
The goal of this project is to make an AI that is able to quickly learn how to play Super Mario Bros. It starts at the first level and will hopefully be able to complete the game.

### AIs to potentially implement: <br />
NEAT :heavy_check_mark:	<br />
HyperNEAT <br />
Q Learning <br />
DDQN (Double Deep Q Learning) <br />



## NEAT AI Playing Mario:
Below is a video of an AI trained using the NEAT Algorithm to play mario. The training took about 24 hours and this was the best agent I got. Through no Human Input it was able to evolve and learn using concepts similar to neuroevolution. The agent was rewarded based on how far it made it into the game and how fast it went.
