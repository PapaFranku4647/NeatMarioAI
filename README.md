# Neat Mario AI

The Neat Mario AI project is dedicated to the development of an intelligent agent capable of mastering the intricacies of Super Mario Bros gameplay. With the initial objective of conquering the first level, the ultimate ambition is to guide the AI towards completing the entire game.

## Implemented and Potential AI Models
The project explores a variety of AI algorithms to enhance gameplay proficiency, including:

- **NEAT** (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) ✔️
- **HyperNEAT**
- **Q Learning**
- **DDQN** (Double Deep Q Learning)

## NEAT AI Showcasing Mario Mastery
Witness the culmination of the NEAT Algorithm's capabilities in the realm of Mario gameplay. The following video captures the achievements of an AI agent that underwent rigorous training over a 24-hour period. Remarkably, this AI learned and evolved without any human intervention, illustrating the essence of neuroevolution. The agent's progress was assessed based on its in-game advancement and swiftness.
